NOTES about project
Use Congress API


Methods used:
1) networks 
2) spatial data
3) naive Bayes

Discussion
- date of being friends on Twitter
- what would have been done ideally
- polarization
- using same hashtags 
- agreement vote, number of connections: statistics on network 
- facebook data: ideally analyze tags, number of likes (classify as friendly or attack)
- Polarization, ML: Predict party? Those who are not clear-cut get an ambiguous score
- neural network: voting behavior --> party; How hard is it to predict this? Polarization 
- is there any development over time?

Possible research questions
- what are the groupings/networks in the congress? 
- voting behavior: are politicians voting more commonly for their districts? 
- how did the network develop over time?


To do
1) Are there Republican/Democrat feature words, word clusters that identify the voting behavior or party from tweets. 
2) Retweets as sign of support or disagreement. How do retweets/mentions relfect voting behavior?
