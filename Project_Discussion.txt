Methods used:
1) networks

Discussion
- date of being freinds on Twitter
- what would have been done ideally
- polarization
- using same hashtags 
- agreement vote, number of connections: statistics on network 
- facebook data: ideally analyze tags, number of likes (classify as friendly or attack)
- Polarization, ML: Predict party? Those who are not clear-cut get an ambiguous score
- neural network: voting behavior --> party; How hard is it to predict this? Polarization 
- is there any development over time?

Possible research questions
- how did the network develop over time?
- what are the groupings/networks in the congress and how it evolved over time? 
- voting behavior are politicians voting more commonly in their district? 


To do
1) how to link the data
2) twitter data: What's the earliest point in time?
3) establish link btw. twitter and congress
