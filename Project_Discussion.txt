NOTES about project


Data
Twitter friends data
Congress voting behavior and districts 


Methods used:
1) networks 
	Jaccard similarity: Shows how similar two sample sets are, ranges from 0-1 with 1 being totally similar 
2) spatial data
3) naive Bayes

Discussion
- date of being friends on Twitter
- what would have been done ideally
- polarization
- using same hashtags 
- agreement vote, number of connections: statistics on network 
- facebook data: ideally analyze tags, number of likes (classify as friendly or attack)
- Polarization, ML: Predict party? Those who are not clear-cut get an ambiguous score
- neural network: voting behavior --> party; How hard is it to predict this? Polarization 
- is there any development over time?

Possible research questions
Do reps/dems who are more linked on twitter with the opposite party also vote more likely against their party lines?
- what are the groupings/networks in the congress? 
- voting behavior: Do representatves from the same region vote similarly? 
- how did the network develop over time?

Random Ideas
Most interesting: Change in voting behavior over and polarization time
How voting behavior differed from party lines over time. 
How would a hypothetical Twitter network look like in 1993 based on voting behavior and party?
	Excercies: Construct a Twitter network d
	Agreement of politicians on each bill --> similarity --> network based on voting


Tasks
1) Are there Republican/Democrat feature words, word clusters that identify the voting behavior or party from tweets. 
2) Retweets as sign of support or disagreement. How do retweets/mentions relfect voting behavior?
